Packet Superframes
------------------

Packet superframes are composed of a 1..n byte data type specifier, 0..797 bytes of
payload data.  The data type specifier is encoded in the same way as UTF-8.  It provides
efficient coding of common data types.  And it can be extended to include a very large
number of distinct packet data type codes.

The data type specifier can also be used as a protocol specifier.  For example,
the following protocol identifers are reserved in the M17 packet spec:

.. list-table::  Reserved Protocols
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Identifer
     - Protocol
   * - 0x00
     - RAW
   * - 0x01
     - AX.25
   * - 0x02
     - APRS
   * - 0x03
     - 6LoWPAN
   * - 0x04
     - IPv4
   * - 0x05
     - SMS
   * - 0x06
     - WinLink

 
The data type specifier is used to compute the CRC, along with the payload.

Encryption Types
----------------

Encryption is optional. The use of it may be restricted within some radio
services and countries, and should only be used if legally permissible.

Null Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Encryption type = :math:`00_2`

No encryption is performed, payload is sent in clear text.

The "Encryption SubType" bits in the Stream Type field then indicate
what data is stored in the 112 bits of the LSF META field.

.. list-table::  
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Encryption SubType bits
     - LSF META data contents
   * - :math:`00_2`
     - UTF-8 Text
   * - :math:`01_2`
     - GNSS Position Data
   * - :math:`10_2`
     - Reserved
   * - :math:`11_2`
     - Reserved

All LSF META data must be stored in big endian byte order, as throughout
the rest of this specification.

GNSS Position Data stores the 112 bit META field as follows:

.. list-table::  
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Size, in bits
     - Format
     - Contents
   * - 32
     - 32-bit fixed point degrees and decimal minutes (TBD)
     - Latitude
   * - 32
     - 32-bit fixed point degrees and decimal minutes (TBD)
     - Longitude
   * - 16
     - unsigned integer
     - Altitude, in feet MSL. Stored +1500, so a stored value of 0 represents -1500 MSL. Subtract 1500 feet when parsing.
   * - 10
     - unsigned integer
     - Course in degrees true North
   * - 10
     - unsigned integer
     - Speed in miles per hour.
   * - 12
     - Reserved values
     - Transmitter/Object description field


Scrambler
~~~~~~~~~

Encryption type = :math:`01_2`

Scrambling is an encryption by bit inversion using a bitwise
exclusive-or (XOR) operation between bit sequence of data and
pseudorandom bit sequence.

Encrypting bitstream is generated using a Fibonacci-topology
Linear-Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).  Three different LFSR sizes are
available: 8, 16 and 24-bit. Each shift register has an associated
polynomial. The polynomials are listed in Table 7. The LFSR is
initialised with a seed value of the same length as the shift
register. Seed value acts as an encryption key for the scrambler
algorithm.  Figures 5 to 8 show block diagrams of the algorithm

.. warning::
    Scrambler "Encryption" is not even remotely secure. LFSR's are entirely 
    reverseable: once an attacker knows even a little key stream, they can easily 
    determine the entire state of the LFSR, which allows them to generate all
    keystream going forward and backward in time.  LFSR states of 8, 16, or even 24 bits
    are trivially brute-forceable.  This is little more than obfuscation to keep
    out only the listeners who don't really care.  Anyone who wants to can break into
    a "Scrambled" stream in real time.

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Encryption type = :math:`10_2`

This method uses AES-128 block cipher in counter (CTR) mode.  CTR mode
requires one block of an IV (Initialization Vector, 128 bits) that is made up
of a 112-bit random nonce, padded to the LSB with zeros.  This 112-bit 
nonce value is provided in the META field.

**FIXME** Key negotiation? The IV and Keys are different things; using a fixed
key and random IV is not secure.

The counter is provided in the FN (Frame Number) field, and always starts 
from 0 (zero) in a new voice stream.  The IV is added to the FN to form the
full Counter in the CTR mode.  Since the 16 LSB in the IV are zero padding,
and the FN is only ever 15 bits, this operation can also be performed by
concatenation instead of addition.

The 16 bit frame number and 40 ms frames can provide for over 20 minutes
of streaming without rolling over the counter [#fn_roll]_.

.. [#fn_roll] The effective capacity of the counter is 15 bits, as the
              MSB is used for transmission end signalling. At 40ms per
              frame, or 25 frames per second, and 2**15 frames, we get
              2**15 frames / 25 frames per second = 1310 seconds, or 21
              minutes and some change.

The security of the system depends on the quality of random numbers used.
The best source of entropy available should be used, ideally a proper
Psudo Random Number Generator algorithm (eg: FIPS SP800-90B [PRNG]_)
that's been seeded with as much hardware based entropy as possible.

.. warning::
    In CTR mode, AES encryption is malleable [CTR]_ [CRYPTO]_.
    That is, an attacker can change the contents of the encrypted message
    without decrypting it. This means that recipients of AES-encrypted data
    must not trust that the data is authentic.
    Users who require that received messages are proven to be exactly as-sent by
    the sender should add application-layer authentication, such as HMAC.
    In the future, use of a different mode, such as Galois/Counter Mode, could
    alleviate this issue [CRYPTO]_.
