# M17_spec

[M17 Project](http://m17project.org/) is a modern, digital radio protocol built by hams, for hams. 
This repository contains the specification describing it exhaustively, from top to bottom. It is still a work in progress, meaning that this repository is meant to be updated now and then. After a few years of development, almost all of the changes are just to supplement the specification with new functions or improve the document.

The specification can be conveniently browsed [here](https://spec.m17project.org/).
