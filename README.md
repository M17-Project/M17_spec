# M17_spec

[M17 Project](http://m17project.org/) is a modern, digital radio protocol built by hams, for hams.
This repository contains the specification describing it exhaustively, from top to bottom. It is still a work in progress, meaning that this repository is meant to be updated now and then. After a few years of development, almost all of the changes are just to supplement the specification with new functions or improve the document.

The specification can be conveniently browsed [here](https://spec.m17project.org/).

If you need a pdf file suitable for printing and binding, see the comment at the first line of the `M17_spec.txt` file.
